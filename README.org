* All the words!

Everything I have written that is freely available lives in this monorepo. Books are in /books and articles/blog posts are in /articles

** Usage

** Publishing

The articles, books etc are all on npm which means they published using =npm publish=. They are scoped to =@k2052-words= e.g =@k2052-words/unicorns-are-awesome=. You can publish an individual article (if you are me) by doing:

#+begin_src sh
$ cd articles/unicorns-are-awesome && npm publish 
#+end_src

You can publish all articles, books etc by using lerna:

#+begin_src 
$ npm run publish
#+end_src

** License 

I use a mixed set of licenses but most articles are probably going to be ISC/MIT. Definitely check the license of the work if you want to use it though, if you cant find a license in the folder then please ask before re-using.
